# Web Page Retrieval

When you need to retrieve or fetch webpage content:

- **Always use `curl` or `wget`** for HTTP requests
- **Never use** browser automation (e.g., MCP browser tools, Playwright, Puppeteer)
- **Never use** JavaScript execution in a browser to retrieve content

Example:

```bash
curl -s "https://example.com/page"
# or
wget -qO- "https://example.com/page"
```
