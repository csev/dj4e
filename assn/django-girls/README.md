Welcome to the Django for Everybody version of the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) specifically adapted for use with PythonAnywhere.

The [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) is widely used around the world at Django meetings, classrooms, and other events.
The real tutorial is much more extensive than this tutorial and covers many different operating systems and deployment options and provides important backgorund material.

Once you've finished this tutorial, you will have a small working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!
