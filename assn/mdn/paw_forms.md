Django Forms and Authentication
===============================

For this task, we will go back to the previous tutorial and add a view
for librarians to see checked all checked out books.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Authentication#Challenge_yourself

Then we will complete the Forms tutorial:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms

Adding the librarian view
-------------------------

This is a set of steps to walk through the challenge that is not included in the MDN tutorial.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Authentication#Challenge_yourself

* In `catalog/models.py`, update the `BookInstance` model and add the permissions line:

        class Meta:
            ordering = ['due_back']
            permissions = (("can_mark_returned", "Set book as returned"),)

* Then run your migration

        cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

* Reload your application, go into the admin page -> Groups and change the 'Library Staff' group
and add the `catalog | book instance | Set book as returned` permission to the group and save the group.

* Add the following to the `urls.py` (this is where we define 'all-borrowed' to fix the error above):

        urlpatterns += [
            path('borrowed/', views.LoanedBooksListView.as_view(), name='all-borrowed'),
        ]

* Add the following to `catalog/views.py`:

        from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin

        class LoanedBooksListView(PermissionRequiredMixin,generic.ListView):
            """Generic class-based view listing books on loan to current user."""
            model = BookInstance
            permission_required = 'catalog.can_mark_returned'
            template_name ='catalog/bookinstance_list_borrowed_all.html'
            paginate_by = 10

            def get_queryset(self):
                return BookInstance.objects.filter(status__exact='o').order_by('due_back')

    Note that `get_queryset()` is quite similar to the same method in `LoadedBooksByUserListView`
    except that we have removed the filter by logged in user.

* Create the template in `catalog/templates/catalog/bookinstance_list_borrowed_all.html`

        {% extends "base_generic.html" %}
        {% block content %}
            <h1>Borrowed books</h1>
            {% if bookinstance_list %}
            <ul>
            {% for bookinst in bookinstance_list %}
            <li class="{% if bookinst.is_overdue %}text-danger{% endif %}">
                <a href="{% url 'book-detail' bookinst.book.pk %}">{{bookinst.book.title}}</a>
                ({{bookinst.borrower}}, {{ bookinst.due_back }})
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            {% else %}
            <p>There are no books borrowed.</p>
            {% endif %}
        {% endblock %}

* Add this to `templates/base_generic.html` right below 'My Borrowed'

        {% if perms.catalog.can_mark_returned %}
          <hr/>
          <li>Staff</li>
          <li><a href="{% url 'all-borrowed'%}">All borrowed</a></li>
        {% endif %}

    Don't surround this with a `user.is_staff` test - just show the link if the
    user has the `catalog.can_mark_returned` permission.   We don't want our library
    staff to be able to access the '/admin' page.

* Then `Reload` the application and log in with an account that is in the group 'Library Members'
and verify that the 'All borrowed` code works.

Adding the renew form
---------------------

Now that we have the 'All borrowed view' lets make some forms to support some librarian use cases.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms

* Create `catalog/forms.py` as described in the tutorial

* Add a pattern to `catalog/urls.py` for the `renew_book_librarian` view

* Add the `renew_book_librarian` view to `catalog/views.py` as described in the tutorial

* Add the `catalog/templates/catalog/book_renew_librarian.html` template as described in tht tutorial

* Update the template in `catalog/templates/catalog/bookinstance_list_borrowed_all.html` to call the new
renewal form from the "all borrowed" view, add these three lines after the 'book-detial' line.

        ...
                <a href="{% url 'book-detail' bookinst.book.pk %}">{{bookinst.book.title}}</a>
                {% if perms.catalog.can_mark_returned %}   
                 - <a href="{% url 'renew-book-librarian' bookinst.id %}">Renew</a>  - 
                {% endif %}
                ({{bookinst.borrower}}, {{ bookinst.due_back }})
        ...

* You should reload your web application and test both the 'All borrowed' view and the librarian renewal
feature.  Make sure when you change the due date that it actually changes.  Try some invalid dates like
next year to test data validation.

The tutorial shows an equivalent way of building a model-based view.  It is not necessary to actually build
this equivalent form.

Adding the CRUD views
---------------------

Continuing with the Forms tutorial, we add three CRUD views:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms#Generic_editing_views

* Add the Create Update, and Delete views to `views.py` as described in the tutorial.  But we want to
only allow logged in users to access these views.  If you want to take the extra step, you can create a new permission
and use the `PermissionRequiredMixin` to be more fine-grained.  At a minimum, make sure that a user must be 
logged in to do the CRUD operations.  

    Simply add the `LoginRequiredMixin` to each of your classes (we imported it earlier in the file)

        class AuthorCreate(LoginRequiredMixin,CreateView):
            model = Author
            fields = '__all__'
            initial = {'date_of_death': '05/01/2018'}

    __You don't want to leave a web site up with some 
    wide-open URLs that accept data from the internet without a log in - that would be very irresponsible
    and make your hosting provider very unhappy.__
        
* Create the `catalog/templates/catalog/author_form.html` template as described in the tutorial

* Create the `catalog/templates/catalog/author_confirm_delete.html` template as described in the tutorial

* Add the url mappings for the Create Update, and Delete views `urls.py` as described in the tutorial

* Test that you can Create, Update, and Delete by logging in as a valid user and manually going to the URLs:

        https://mdntutorial.pythonanywhere.com/catalog/author/create/
        https://mdntutorial.pythonanywhere.com/catalog/author/12/update
        https://mdntutorial.pythonanywhere.com/catalog/author/12/delete

    You can go into an author detail page and add "update" or "delete" to the end of the URL to access
    those views.

Congratulations
---------------

If you have made it this far, you have seen a lot of the patterns used in developing a Django application.
Hopefully you learned some of it along the way as you move into building your own applications from scratch
going forward.
