Django Models
=============

Our next step is to add some models to our LocalLibrary application so we can store
data in our database.

Read and understand the tutorial, and when you get to the section titled
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models#Defining_the_LocalLibrary_Models" target="_blank">Defining the LocalLibrary Models</a>,
go to your
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a>
account and start a bash shell.

Lets go into the locallibrary project:

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary

Make sure that you have properly edited the `locallibrary/settings.py` file
to register your catalog
application within the locallibrary project by adding `CatalogConfig` line.

Edit the file `catalog/models.py` and add the `Genre`, `Book`, `BookInstance`, and `Author` models
as described in the tutorial.  Once you have added models models, run the migrations
from `~/django_projects/locallibrary`

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
    python manage.py makemigrations

    Migrations for 'catalog':
      catalog/migrations/0001_initial.py
        - Create model Author
        - Create model Book
        - Create model BookInstance
        - Create model Genre
        - Create constraint genre_name_case_insensitive_unique on model genre
        - Add field book to bookinstance
        - Add field author to book
        - Add field genre to book

If the `makemigrations` encounters errors, stop, fix the error and re-run `makemigrations` until
it is successfull.

    python manage.py migrate

Then add the `Language` model to your `models.py` as discussed in the "Challenge" section
at the end of the tutorial.  You can skim and think through the "design a model" part of the
tutorial - but for the sake of time, here is a Language model you can use:

    class Language(models.Model):
        """Model representing a Language (e.g. English, French, Japanese, etc.)"""
        name = models.CharField(max_length=200,
                            unique=True,
                            help_text="Enter the book's natural language (e.g. English, French, Japanese etc.)")

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            """Returns the url to access a particular language instance."""
            return reverse('language-detail', args=[str(self.id)])

        def __str__(self):
            """String for representing the Model object (in Admin site etc.)"""
            return self.name

    class Meta:
            constraints = [
                UniqueConstraint(
                    Lower('name'),
                    name='language_name_case_insensitive_unique',
                    violation_error_message = "Language already exists (case insensitive match)"
                ),
            ]

Since we have changed the `models.py` by adding the `Language` model, we need to run the migrations again:

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
    python manage.py makemigrations

    Migrations for 'catalog':
      catalog/migrations/0002_language_and_more.py
        - Create model Language
        - Create constraint language_name_case_insensitive_unique on model language

You can repeat the process of editing the `models.py` file and re-running the makemigrations until you get them
right and then run `migrate` to actually create/update the tables in the database.

    python manage.py migrate

If you are using the autograder for this assignment, you will need to upload the
`~/django_projects/locallibrary/db.sqlite3` file.  If you are using PythonAnywhere you can use the Files tab
to download the file to your computer and then upload it to the autograder.

If Your Model/Database Gets Messed Up
-------------------------------------

If you want to clean up your database and start with a
fresh database using the following instructions:

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
    rm */migrations/00*
    rm db.sqlite3
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser    # If needed

You need to recreate the superuser because it is stored in the database
and the `rm` command emptied out your database.  You can do
this process any time your database feels like it is messed up.  But
you have to re-enter all your accounts and data.
