Starting the MDN Tutorial
=========================

This assignment will switch your
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere</a>
account to a brand new <b>project</b>.  We won't delete your <b>mysite</b>
project - we will make a new project and point your PythonAnywhere Web application at
this new project - so your previous work will disapper from the web - but
the source code for your previous work still be there if you wanted to switch back.

__NOTE:__ If you find a complete solution to this assignment somewhere out there, do
*not* use it for these assignments.  The autograders expect you to do these assignments
*one at a time* and pass each autograder before going on to the next autograder.  If you find
some sample code outside of the actual tutorial pages - it is fine to look at it to check your
work, but you will get youself in trouble if you use it as a short-cut.

If you get completely confused, you can quite easily start over from the beginning.  See
the instructions at the bottom of this page to start over.

Checking Your Installation
--------------------------

We assume that you have a Django virtual environment all set up from your
previous assignments.  Start a shell and type:

    python -m django --version

It should show a version like `5.2`

We will start the MDN tutorial at step 3.  You can read the first two steps -
but you can start at the "Skeleton Website" step.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/skeleton_website

*Note:* If you are submitting these assignments to the autograder, make sure you finish
grading of one assignment before starting on the next assignment.  The autograder deducts
points for haing *too many* features implemented.

Since you already have a `django_projects` folder your first step in the tutorial does
not require a `mkdir` command - instead:

    cd ~/django_projects
    django-admin startproject locallibrary
    cd locallibrary

Edit the file `locallibrary/settings.py` and make the following changes:

    DEBUG = True                        # Do not change to False

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']               # Change

Go find the `STATIC_URL` line in `settings.py` and add the following two lines below it.

    STATIC_URL = '/static/'  # Existing line in settings.py

    import os
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'catalog/static')  # New line

Continue with the Tutorial
--------------------------

**Read this entire section before you start the tutorial.  In particular when the
tutorial tells you to `runserver` come back to these instructions.**

We will start the tutorial at the step *Creating the catalog application*:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/skeleton_website#creating_the_catalog_application

starting with the command:

    cd ~/django_projects/locallibrary
    python manage.py startapp catalog

When you get to get to the instructions in the tutorial where you are
editing `locallibrary/urls.py`, *do not add* `permanent=True`
if the tutorial tells you to do so - just leave it out. 

Don't do this:

        path('', RedirectView.as_view(url='catalog/', permanent=True)),

Do this instead:

        path('', RedirectView.as_view(url='catalog/')),

At some point the instructions tell you to run

	python manage.py makemigrations

If you get an error - do not proceed any further in the tutorial until the `makemigrations`
works.  A `makemigrations` error might look like

    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 846, in exec_module
    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 983, in get_code
    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 913, in source_to_code
    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 228, in _call_with_frames_removed
    File "/home/mdntutorial/django_projects/locallibrary/locallibrary/urls.py", line 35
      ]
    ^
    SyntaxError: closing parenthesis ']' does not match opening parenthesis '(' on line 34

Figure out what is wrong and fix it, and re-run `makemigrations` until it succeeds and then
proceed with the tutorial.

Continue with the tutorial until it tells you to `python manage.py runserver` - instead do

	python manage.py check

and keep running `check` until there are no errors.

Remember that on PythonAnywhere, we __never__ do a `runserver` but instead use the Web
tab to point to and start our Django application.

Also we never navigate to `http://localhost:8000` - our web server is on PythonAnywhere and the next
section reconfigures your PythonAnywhere account to server the new `locallibrary` project.

The tutorial talks about backing your code up to github - this is not necessary unless you are familiar
familiar with github and want to back things up.  In general most students get stuck on the github part
so we don't recommend it.

Switching Your Web Application to a New Project (instead of runserver)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We need to go into the `Web` tab in PythonAnywhere and *switch* which project your
account is serving at your application URL.

Scroll down to the *Code:* section and make the following settings (replace 'mdntutorial'
with your PYAW account):

    Source code: /home/mdntutorial/django_projects/locallibrary
    Working directory: /home/mdntutorial/django_projects/locallibrary

**Important:** Edit the *WSGI Configuration File* and change `mysite` to `locallibrary` in two places
and save it.  Your *WSGI Configuration File* should look as follows after you edit it:

    import os
    import sys

    path = os.path.expanduser('~/django_projects/locallibrary')
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, path)
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'locallibrary.settings'
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    from django.contrib.staticfiles.handlers import StaticFilesHandler
    application = StaticFilesHandler(get_wsgi_application())

The virtual environment and Python version should already be set up and does not need to change.

    Virtualenv: /home/mdntutorial/.ve52

Change `mdntutorial` above to your PythonAnywhere account name.

Then `Reload` your web application and visit its url to make sure you get the expected output.

    http://mdntutorial.pythonanywhere.com/catalog/

When you visit the page,
you *should* get an error, 'Page not found(404)'
(<a href="paw_skeleton/webapp_final.png" target="_blank">Sample Image</a>).
We are stopping this tutorial when the web site is still incomplete so that is normal.

You can ignore the instructions about putting everything in a github repo - it is not requried for this assignment.

Common Problems and How to Fix Them
-----------------------------------

If you received an "Error not found" page that does not look like the above image,
check to make sure that you have `DEBUG = True` in your `settings.py` file.  If you
set `DEBUG` to `False`, it will make it far more difficult to track down errors in
your code.  Setting it to `True` means that error pages give far more detail.

If you reload your web application and get the "Something went wrong :("
page when you access your web application, check on the "error.log" link
and scroll to the very bottom to see why your application will not start.

If you reload your application and get a messgage like "Coming soon", your
PythonAnywhere account might have expired
(<a href="paw_skeleton/web_renew.png" target="_blank">screen shot</a>).  All you need to
extend your account is go into PythonAnywhere -> Web -> "Run until 3 months from today" and then
Reload your web application.  You do not lose files, databases or configuration when your account
"expires" - once you extend it they all come back.

Starting Over
-------------

If you pasted in too much stuff or deleted a large amount of text, and want to start over
it is quite easy.  We just rename the `locallibrary` folder:

	cd ~/django_projects
    mv locallibrary broken1

and then go to the top of this file and do everything over starting with `startproject`.
