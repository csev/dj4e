Editing Files on PythonAnywhere
===============================

There are three ways to edit files in your PythonAnywhere environment, ranging from the easiest
to the coolest.  You only have to edit the file one of these ways.

(1) Go to the main PythonAnywhere dashboard, browse files, navigate to the correct folder and edit the file

    /home/drchuck/django_projects/mysite/mysite/settings.py

(2) Or in the command line:

    cd ~/django_projects/mysite/mysite/
    nano settings.py

    Save the File by pressing 'CTRL-X', 'Y', and Enter

(3) Don't try this most difficult and most cool way to edit files on Linux without a helper
if it is your first time with the `vi` text editor.

    cd ~/django_projects/mysite/mysite/
    vi settings.py

Once you have opened `vi`, cursor down to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` line,
position your cursor between the braces and press the
`i` key to go into 'INSERT' mode, then type your new text and press the `esc` key when you are
done.  To save the file, you type `:wq` followed by `enter`.  If you get lost press `escape` `:q!`
`enter` to get out of the file without saving.

If you aleady know some _other_ command line text editor in Linux, you can use it to edit files.  In general,
you will find that it often quicker and easier to make small edits to files in the command line
rather than a full screen UI.  And once you start deploying real applications in production
environments like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.. all you will have is command line.
